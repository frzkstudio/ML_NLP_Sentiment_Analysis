![Sentiment Analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sentiment%20Analysis-NLP-success.svg)

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves analyzing text data to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in the text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Overview

### Description
- Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews from an e-commerce platform to gain insights into customer opinions and product satisfaction.
- Built and evaluated machine learning models for sentiment classification.

### Tools/Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Skills Demonstrated
- Text preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Model building: Implemented and evaluated various machine learning models.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for sentiment classification.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data**: Contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis. The dataset includes customer reviews with labeled sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

2. **Notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for each step of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Models**: Contains saved machine learning models trained for sentiment analysis.
